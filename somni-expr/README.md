This crate implements the expression evaluation subset of the Somnni language and VM. The crate
is useful by itself, to evaluate simple expressions or even to run complete Somni programs, although
slower than the Somni VM.

The design goals of this crate are:

- Be simple and easy to use.
- Provide useful errors.
